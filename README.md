# GitRepD
GitRepD is a GitHub repository app that lets you browse through user repositories and save some information about them on your device.

## Technologies and architecrure
GitRepD is based on **iOS 15** and __Swift 5.5__ using __XCode 13.0 beta 5__. The app is **entirely native**, making it free from external dependancies and more reliable in terms of faster updates, bug fixes and future design changes.

The architecture of the app is __VIPER__ with few twists due to the **SwiftUI** nature. For example, the data model or the Entities (which is the most inner layer in clean architecture) needs to be tightly coupled with the persistence (which sits in the most outer layer). This doest break the rule of clean architecture where the inner layer should know nothing about the outer layer. This is so because VIPER doesnâ€™t translate well to SwiftUI, so some compromises had to be made.

__Combine__, __CoreData__ and __async/await__ functions has also been used.

## App Specification
The app starts off with 2 tab bars. One for repository searches and another for browsing through favorites (saved repositories). After the user searches for a repository and upon selecting one by tapping, a detailed screen appears that displays more information about the selected item (image, repository name, date created, language used, description and a url with an option to follow it upon tap). The user can save the selected repository eitherv by tapping on the star button at the detail screen or simply by swiping from the leading edge to the trailing from the search screen. The delete action is the same but from the other direcrtion (if in database). The aforementioned is applicable to the favorites screen, except for the star button at the detail view.

The search screen is paginated and fetches up to 10 results at a time upon scroll to the end of the list. Alert messages and **haptic feedback** depending on the context has also been provided.

## Requirements
XCode 13 or newer.

## Installation
No external librtaries are needed for installation because the entire app is built withj native technologies from Apple.

What is worth to mention is that upon cloning the project, you may want to clean the build folder before initial build because the app might crash due to CoreData. In order to do that you need to go to:

__XCode 13__ (or newer) -> Product (from the menu bar at the top) -> Clean Build Folder

Alternatively, the cmd + shift + k key combination should do the trick.

Also, if you have an older version of the app installed, you should delete it and re-install before launching the new version because the app might crash due to the older version of the CoreData database if there are any changes to the database context.
